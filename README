Source Server Remote Console v1.0.5
by Alexander AB (lxndr87i@gmail.com)

This is a simple programm that allows you to connect to
a valve source engine server with the rcon protocol.

To compile it, just type 'make'


Usage: srcon <options> <host>[:<port>]
	-p <password>		server rcon password
	-v			version information
	-h			some help about options
	-c <commands>		commands to send on startup
	-i			interactive shell mode
	-t <color code>		shell prompt color
	-q			only print server responses


Option -p  <password> is mandatory.

The interactive (-i) mode allows you to login, send as many commands
as you want to, and logout (with 'logout' command). If -i is not specified,
query mode is active.

The query mode is mainly intended for scripts. It connects to a server,
sends all the commands provided by command line and standard input,
waits for response and prints it into stdout, and then automatically
disconnects. By default query mode outputs info messages. If you only
need server response, use -q option.

You can use -c option and stdin pipe together. Commands from -c option
are sent first.

Color code must be one of your system shell colors, like '0;31', '1;33'.
Because ; is a command separator, value must be quoted.

Running in interactive mode with a pipe will still send all commands
from stdin, but will cause srcon to disconnect immediately.


Examples
	Start as an interactive rcon shell:
	srcon -i -p example-password example.com:27015
	
	Run with commands, for instance in scripts:
	srcon -q -c 'sv_cheats 1' -p example-password example.com:27015
	
	Run with commands from pipe:
	cat srcds_work | srcon -p example-password example.com:27015
