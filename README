Source Server Remote Console v1.0.5
by Alexander AB (lxndr87i@gmail.com)

This is a simple programm that allows you to connect to
a valve source engine server with the rcon protocol.

To compile it, just type 'make'

Usage: srcon <options> <host>[:<port>]
	-p <password>
	-v for version information
	-h for help
	-c <commands>
	-i interactive mode

-p <password> is a mandatory option.

If -i is not specified, query mode is active.

You can use -c option and stdin pipe together. Commands from -c option
are sent first.

Running in interactive mode with a pipe will still send all commands
from stdin, but will cause srcon to disconnect immediately.

Examples
	Start as an interactive rcon shell:
	srcon -i -p example-password example.com:27015
	
	Run with commands, for instance in scripts:
	srcon -c 'sv_cheats 1' -p example-password example.com:27015
	
	Run with commands from pipe:
	cat srcds_work | srcon -p example-password example.com:27015
